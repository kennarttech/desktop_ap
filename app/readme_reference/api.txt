Flask is a web application framework for building web applications, including web APIs. It provides a set of tools and libraries for developing web APIs, such as routing, request handling, and response formatting. Flask is flexible and allows developers to create APIs in a variety of ways.

On the other hand, REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services. RESTful APIs are built using these constraints and are designed to be stateless, meaning that the server does not keep track of the client's state between requests. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URLs to access and manipulate resources.

So, Flask is a tool to build web applications and APIs, while REST is a set of constraints and principles that can be used to design web APIs. Flask can be used to build RESTful APIs, but it's not a requirement. It's possible to build APIs with Flask that do not conform to the REST architectural style.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main difference between REST APIs and Flask APIs is that Flask APIs are built using the Flask web framework, while REST APIs are built using the REST architectural style. Flask provides a lot of features and tools that make it easier to build web applications and APIs, while REST provides a set of constraints and properties that define how APIs should be designed and implemented.
